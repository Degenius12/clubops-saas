🎯 ClubOps SaaS - CORS Fix Deployment Bootstrap

Step 1: System Discovery
"List my available functions and check directory C:/Users/tonyt/Claude-Workflows"

Step 2: Initialize Super-Agent Mode
"Read file C:/Users/tonyt/Claude-Workflows/CLAUDE_INITIALIZATION_PROMPT.md and follow the complete initialization sequence"

Step 3: Execute ClubOps CORS Fix & Analysis
"I need you to complete the ClubOps-SaaS CORS fix deployment at C:/Users/tonyt/ClubOps-SaaS/ using the super-agent orchestration approach.

CRITICAL CONTEXT: The previous chat identified CORS issues blocking frontend-backend communication and prepared fixes but did NOT deploy them yet. You need to execute the deployment.

READY FOR DEPLOYMENT:
- ✅ CORS fix applied to backend/vercel.json 
- ✅ Deployment script created: CORS_FIX_DEPLOYMENT.bat
- ✅ Test suite created: CORS_TEST_SUITE.html
- ❌ DEPLOYMENT NOT EXECUTED - needs to be done now

Follow this agent sequence:
1. Planning Agent: Analyze current status and verify CORS fix readiness (READ-ONLY)
2. Architect: Review CORS configuration and deployment strategy (READ-ONLY)  
3. Security Scout: Validate environment variables and security (READ-ONLY)
4. Performance Guru: Assess deployment impact and optimizations (READ-ONLY)
5. Debugger: Verify CORS fixes are correct before deployment (READ-ONLY)
6. Code Agent: Execute CORS_FIX_DEPLOYMENT.bat script (FULL ACCESS)
7. Test Runner: Run CORS_TEST_SUITE.html and validate fixes (READ-ONLY)
8. Documentation Agent: Update deployment documentation (LIMITED)

IMPORTANT: You have access to Desktop Commander and MCP tools. Use proper context bridging between agents and track progress in Notion dashboards.

DEPLOYMENT TARGET:
- Frontend: https://frontend-1ech7j3jl-tony-telemacques-projects.vercel.app
- Backend: https://clubops-backend-pgynfiz9g-tony-telemacques-projects.vercel.app
- Test credentials: admin@clubops.com / password"
