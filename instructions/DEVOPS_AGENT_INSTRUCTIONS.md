# DEVOPS AGENT - ClubOps Production Deployment + SaaS Infrastructure

## CONTEXT & REQUIREMENTS
Set up production infrastructure for ClubOps main app + SaaS scaling capabilities.
Support multi-tenant architecture with high availability and performance.

### Production Requirements (from PRD):
- Frontend deployment with CDN (premium UI performance)
- Backend API with auto-scaling (multi-club support)
- PostgreSQL database with replication
- Redis caching layer for offline sync
- File storage for music uploads (MP3/AAC/FLAC/WAV)
- SSL certificates and domain management
- Monitoring and alerting

### SaaS Infrastructure Required:
- Multi-tenant database scaling
- Payment webhook endpoints (Stripe)
- Usage analytics collection pipeline
- Automated backups and disaster recovery
- CI/CD pipeline for rapid deployments
- Environment-based feature flags

## TOOLS: Terminal Commands + Cloud Platforms

## TASK: Deploy complete production infrastructure

### Step 1: Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
```bash
cd C:\Users\tonyt\ClubOps-SaaS\frontend
npm run build
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
vercel domains add clubops.com
vercel domains add *.clubops.com  # Multi-tenant subdomains
```

### Step 2: Backend Infrastructure (Railway/Render)
```bash
cd C:\Users\tonyt\ClubOps-SaaS\backend
# Create Dockerfile
docker build -t clubops-api .
# Deploy to Railway
railway login
railway new clubops-api
railway up
```

### Step 3: Database Setup (Supabase/PlanetScale)
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- Multi-tenant row-level security
- Automated backups (daily + weekly)
- Read replicas for analytics queries

### Step 4: Caching & Storage
- Redis Cloud for session storage + offline sync
- AWS S3/Cloudflare R2 for music file storage
- CDN configuration for static assets

### Step 5: Monitoring & Security
- Sentry for error tracking
- LogRocket for user session replay
- Uptime monitoring (99.9% SLA)
- Security headers and rate limiting

### Step 6: CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
- Automated testing on PR
- Staging deployment for review
- Production deployment on merge to main
- Database migration automation

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [ ] Frontend deployed with custom domain + SSL
- [ ] Backend API operational with auto-scaling
- [ ] Database configured with multi-tenant support
- [ ] File storage working for music uploads
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional
- [ ] Performance targets met (< 2s load times)
